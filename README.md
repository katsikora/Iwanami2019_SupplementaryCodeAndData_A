## Summary

This document provides the R code and accompanying explanations to reproduce Figures 1 e-f, 6 a-d, 7 b as well as Supplementary Figures 2 b-d and 5 a from the manuscript with working title “Transgenerational inheritance of impaired larval T cell development in zebrafish” by Iwanami et al..
The analysis starts with SNP and coverage-filtered methylation ratios as well as tables with results of differential methylation analysis and walks the reader through the data processing underlying the manuscript figures. A copy of this document will be deposited on GitHub under https://github.com/katsikora/Iwanami2019_SupplementaryCodeAndData_A upon publication.
The code is formatted in a way to facilitate understanding and interpretation by a lay R user. This code is authored by Katarzyna Sikora.

Raw sequencing data has been submitted to GEO and is available under the ID GSE98647.
Processed data files used in the R vignette contained in this repo are stored on the German GWDG cloud due to file size restrictions on GitHub.
The Rmd/html document provides download links to the processed data files.
